# Architecture Notes

Use this folder for:
- Detailed sequence diagrams for intake, validation, dialogue, and generation flows.
- Data model docs describing how bilingual datasets are normalized and linked.
- ADRs covering technology choices (LLMs, vector stores, translation models, UI framework).
- Compliance and accessibility considerations (WCAG, audit logging, privacy constraints).

Keep files concise and link them from the root README as they evolve.
